# Power Testing

## Setup

To set up for this test you will need ubuntu. It is handy to use a USB stick to install it.  See [These instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#3-create-a-bootable-usb-stick) to create one.

After you have booted the host and it has a generic internet connection you will want to run the [setup.sh](./setup.sh)

```shell

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbitter78/server_stress/main/Power/setup.sh)"

```
